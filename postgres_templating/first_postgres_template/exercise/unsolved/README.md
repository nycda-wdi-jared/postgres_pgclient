# GET Products Exercise

<strong>1. First</strong>
* Create a get route that sends the id & product columns from the products table to the client
* Append the products (index + 1) number under the "#" column
* Append the products name to the "product column"

<strong>2. Second</strong>
* Through Postico
	* Add a description column to your product table
	* Insert the descriptions manually for each product
* Create a get route that sends only the description column from the products table to the client
* Store a data-id in all of the tr's in the tbody through jQuery
* 'onmouseover' each row (tr) on the table displays the products description under it
	* dont forget to empty the div to make sure descriptions dont continuously append
* 'onmouseout' from the tr's/table removes the description completely
